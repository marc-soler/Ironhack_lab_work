## Key take aways
- The best performing model, based on their indicators, is actually the base model (Model (X)), with an explained variance of roughly 77% and a mean average error (MAE) of 87.7. Therefore, this model allows us to predict the total claimed amount of a certain customer (as long as its features are similar to the ones in our sample) within a margin of 87.7$.

- Other insights, albeit not very promising, are that a lot of relevant data is missing, and most of the available one barely correlates with the set label.
